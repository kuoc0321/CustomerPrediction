# Customer Churn Prediction

Customer churn prediction is a critical process for identifying customers likely to leave a company or stop using its product or service. This project focuses on building a predictive model for customer churn, specifically designed for applications like banking. 

By predicting customer churn, businesses can:
- Better understand the factors leading to customer attrition.
- Identify and address underlying issues, such as poor service or irrelevant products.
- Improve overall customer retention and satisfaction.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Explore customer datasets to uncover key factors related to churn.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implement machine learning models to classify and predict churn behavior.
- **Interpretability**: Identify actionable insights from the predictive models to aid decision-making.
